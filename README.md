# A-B-testing-on-Ad-data
This project involves analyzing the effectiveness of two separate ad campaigns, one on Facebook and the other on AdWords. The objective is to determine which platform yields better results in terms of clicks, conversions, and cost-effectiveness by exploring key performance metrics such as CTR, CPC.


**AB Testing on Facebook and AdWords Ad Campaigns**

**Overview:**

This project focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of two distinct advertising campaigns executed on Facebook and AdWords throughout the year 2019. The primary goal is to evaluate the performance of each platform by comparing metrics such as clicks, conversions, and overall cost-effectiveness. By understanding these metrics, the project aims to optimize resource allocation and improve return on investment (ROI) for future advertising strategies.

**Project Structure:**

- **Business Problem:**  
  The notebook begins by outlining the business problem, which is to maximize ROI for clients' advertising campaigns by identifying the more effective platform between Facebook and AdWords.

- **Data Description:**  
  The dataset used in this project includes daily data from 2019, with key features such as Ad Views, Ad Clicks, Ad Conversions, Cost per Ad, CTR, Conversion Rate, and CPC. These features are used to assess the effectiveness of each ad campaign over time.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  EDA is performed to visualize and understand the distribution and trends within the data. This includes analyzing the performance metrics across both platforms, identifying patterns, and comparing their effectiveness.

- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Various statistical methods are employed to rigorously compare the ad campaigns. Hypothesis testing is conducted to ascertain whether differences in performance metrics between Facebook and AdWords are statistically significant.

- **Modeling:**  
  Predictive models are developed using linear regression to forecast future trends and estimate the impact of different factors on ad performance. The accuracy of these models is evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- **Conclusions and Recommendations:**  
  The project concludes with actionable insights derived from the analysis, offering recommendations on which ad platform is better suited for future campaigns based on the data-driven findings.

**How to Use:**

This project is a comprehensive case study in evaluating the effectiveness of digital ad campaigns across two major platforms: Facebook and AdWords. As a data scientist, youâ€™ll appreciate the methodological rigor applied in analyzing over 365 days of campaign data to assess key performance indicators (KPIs) like Click-Through Rate (CTR), Conversion Rate, and Cost per Click (CPC). By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, this project not only compares the efficiency of each platform but also provides actionable insights to optimize marketing spend, ensuring maximum return on investment (ROI) for clients.
